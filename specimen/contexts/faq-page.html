          What are the barriers to open culture? What challenges do cultural
          heritage institutions &mdash; such as galleries, libraries, archives,
          and museums (GLAMs) &mdash; face in making their collections openly
          accessible online? How could Creative Commons support institutions in
          addressing these challenges and taking part in better sharing of
          cultural heritage?
        </p>

        <p>
          In search of answers, we looked at past research, notably Andrea
          Wallace's Barriers to Open Access &mdash; Open GLAM, and asked more
          than 30 experts in the open culture movement. You can watch what they
          told us in our CC Open Culture VOICES vlog series. Here's a small
          sample of what we heard:

              Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables
              sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the
              provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want
              to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under
              generous, standardized terms; those who want to make creative uses
              of works; and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis. Our
              vision is to help others realize the full potential of the
              internet. CC has affiliates
              <a
                href="https://creativecommons.org/2008/10/01/international-oer-community-update/"
                >all over the world</a
              >
              who help ensure our licenses work internationally and who raise
              awareness of our work.

            <p>
              Although Creative Commons is best known for its licenses, our work
              extends beyond just providing copyright licenses. CC offers other
              legal and technical tools that also facilitate sharing and
              discovery of creative works, such as
              <a href="https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/">CC0</a>, a
              public domain dedication for rights holders who wish to put their
              work into the public domain before the expiration of copyright,
              and the
              <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/"
                >Public Domain Mark</a
              >, a tool for marking a work that is in the worldwide public
              domain. Creative Commons licenses and tools were designed
              specifically to work with the web, which makes content that is
              offered under their terms easy to search for, discover, and use.

              >. CC licenses are copyright licenses, and depend on the existence
              of copyright to work. CC licenses are legal tools that creators
              and other rights holders can use to offer certain usage rights to
              the public, while reserving other rights. Those who want to make
              their work available to the public for limited kinds of uses while
              preserving their copyright may want to consider using CC licenses.
              Others who want to reserve all of their rights under copyright law
              should not use CC licenses.

              That said, Creative Commons recognizes the need for change in
              copyright law, and many members of the Creative Commons community
              are active participants in the copyright reform movement. For more

                >Copyright</a
              >
              grants to creators a bundle of exclusive rights over their
              creative works, which generally include, at a minimum, the right
              to reproduce, distribute, display, and make adaptations. The
              phrase “All Rights Reserved” is often used by owners to indicate
              that they reserve all of the rights granted to them under the law.
              When copyright expires, the work enters the
              <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain"
                >public domain</a
              >, and the rights holder can no longer stop others from engaging
              in those activities under copyright, with the exception of moral
              rights reserved to creators in some jurisdictions. Creative
              Commons licenses offer creators a spectrum of choices between
              retaining all rights and relinquishing all rights (public domain),
              an approach we call “Some Rights Reserved.”

              No. Creative Commons is not a law firm and does not provide legal
              advice or legal services. CC is similar to a self-help service
              that offers free, form-based legal documents for others to use.

              No, CC does not collect content or track licensed material.
              However, CC builds technical tools that help the public search for
              and use works licensed under our licenses and other legal tools,
              and many others have built such tools as well.<a

                >CC Search</a
              >
              is one tool developed by CC to help the public discover works
              offered under Creative Commons licenses on the internet via
              CC-aware search engines and repositories.

              The CC buttons are a shorthand way to convey the basic permissions
              associated with material offered under CC licenses. Creators and
              owners who apply CC licenses to their material can
              <a href="https://creativecommons.org/mission/downloads/"
                >download and apply those buttons</a
              >
              to communicate to users the permissions granted in advance. When
              the material is offered online, the buttons should usually link
              out to the human-readable license deeds (which, in turn, link to
              the license itself).

              Among other things, if you use the logos on a website or on your

              changing the font, the proportions, or the colors. CC's buttons,

              policies unless you first receive express, written permission.
              This means, for example, that you cannot (without our permission)
              print your own buttons and t-shirts using CC logos, although you
              can purchase them in CC’s store.

        <h3>Along The Way We Try</h3>

        <p>
          Along with 600 million people, nine-year-old Chris Hadfield is glued
          to his television&mdash;watching intently as American astronaut Neil
          Armstrong glides down the ladder of the Lunar Module, and in one swift
          pounce, touches the dust of a familiar yet alien world. His words
          forever immortalized, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap
          for mankind."
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Assemble module</li>
          <li>Launch aircraft</li>
          <li>Land safely</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          “To see that successfully carried out against what seemed like
          impossible odds for the first time in human history,” Hadfield
          recalled in 2012, “was hugely inspiring.” That moment sparked his
          lifelong journey to become an astronaut; which he did, becoming the
          first Canadian to walk in space in 2001. In the 1990s, Haley Harrison
          first heard Armstrong's words on an educational tape about space. “I
          was very young, probably 4 or 5 years old,” she recollected, “I just
          listened to the tape over and over. I would imagine myself on the
          shuttle…and I would pretend I was going up to space.” Harrison is now
          a Ph.D. candidate studying nanoscience at The University of North
          Carolina at Greensboro, with goals of working in the space industry.

            really wants people to use them.

          Footage and audio of the
          <a href="#">Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong</a> and lunar module
          pilot Buzz Aldrin hopping on the Moon's surface in 1969 have been
          remixed, remastered, and reshared countless times—inspiring
          generations of everyday citizens, like Hadfield and Harrison, to
          engage
          <em>with</em>
          space science and exploration. In fact, the use of materials created
          by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to create
          new works for the public doesn't end with Armstrong's history-making
          first steps.

          <li>Launch aircraft</li>
          <li>Land safely</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          For example, Alex G. Orphanos, a science communicator, engineer, and
          host of the Today in Space podcast, has put NASA's materials to use
          for over six years. In particular, he has used images from the Hubble
          Space Telescope and information from NASA Procurement to better
          explain space-related issues to his audience. Rachael Eidson, a
          business development specialist for
          <strong>Trenton Systems</strong> and social media influencer also
          routinely uses NASA's images in her collaborations with eco-fashion
          and accessory companies. In fact, it's hard to miss the resurgence of
          space-themed items, including t-shirts, mugs, bags, etc. featuring
          NASA's “meatball” logo. As the L.A. Times reported in 2019, “The NASA
          logo is having a moment.”
