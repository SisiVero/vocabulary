            <p>What are the barriers to open culture? What challenges do cultural heritage institutions &mdash; such as
                galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs) &mdash; face in making their collections openly
                accessible online? How could Creative Commons support institutions in addressing these challenges and
                taking part in better sharing of cultural heritage?</p>

            <p>In search of answers, we looked at past research, notably Andrea Wallace's Barriers to Open Access
                &mdash; Open GLAM, and asked more than 30 experts in the open culture movement. You can watch what they
                told us in our CC Open Culture VOICES vlog series. Here's a small sample of what we heard:</p>

                    <p>Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and reuse of
                        creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help
                        those who want to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous,
                        standardized terms; those who want to make creative uses of works; and those who want to
                        benefit from this symbiosis. Our vision is to help others realize the full potential of the
                        internet. CC has affiliates <a
                            href="https://creativecommons.org/2008/10/01/international-oer-community-update/">all over
                            the world</a> who help ensure our licenses work
                        internationally and who raise awareness of our work.
                    <p>Although Creative Commons is best known for its licenses, our work extends beyond just
                        providing copyright licenses. CC offers other legal and technical tools that also facilitate
                        sharing and discovery of creative works, such as <a
                            href="https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/">CC0</a>, a public domain dedication for
                        rights
                        holders who wish to put their work into the public domain before the expiration of
                        copyright, and the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/">Public Domain
                            Mark</a>, a tool for marking a work that is in the worldwide
                        public domain. Creative Commons licenses and tools were designed specifically to work with
                        the web, which makes content that is offered under their terms easy to search for, discover,
                        and use.</p>

                    <p>Absolutely not. CC has <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2010/06/30/response-to-ascaps-deceptive-claims/">responded to claims to the contrary</a>. CC licenses are copyright
                        licenses, and depend on the existence of copyright to work. CC licenses are legal tools that
                        creators and other rights holders can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while
                        reserving other rights. Those who want to make their work available to the public for
                        limited kinds of uses while preserving their copyright may want to consider using CC
                        licenses. Others who want to reserve all of their rights under copyright law should not use
                        CC licenses.</p>
                       <p> That said, Creative Commons recognizes the need for change in copyright law, and many
                        members of the Creative Commons community are active participants in the copyright reform
                        movement. For more information, see our <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/policy-advocacy-copyright-reform/reform/">statement in support of copyright reform</a>.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-copyright-and-why-does-it-matter">Copyright</a> grants to creators a bundle of exclusive rights over their creative works, which
                        generally include, at a minimum, the right to reproduce, distribute, display, and make
                        adaptations. The phrase “All Rights Reserved” is often used by owners to indicate that they
                        reserve all of the rights granted to them under the law. When copyright expires, the work
                        enters the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>, and the rights holder can no longer stop others from engaging in
                        those activities under copyright, with the exception of moral rights reserved to creators in
                        some jurisdictions. Creative Commons licenses offer creators a spectrum of choices between
                        retaining all rights and relinquishing all rights (public domain), an approach we call “Some

            <h3>Along The Way We Try</h3>


            <p>Along with 600 million people, nine-year-old Chris Hadfield is glued to his television&mdash;watching
                intently as American astronaut Neil Armstrong glides down the ladder of the Lunar Module, and in one
                swift pounce, touches the dust of a familiar yet alien world. His words forever immortalized,
                "That's
                one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Assemble module</li>
                <li>Launch aircraft</li>
                <li>Land safely</li>
            </ul>

            <p>“To see that successfully carried out against what seemed like impossible odds for the first time in
                human history,” Hadfield recalled in 2012, “was hugely inspiring.” That moment sparked his lifelong
                journey to become an astronaut; which he did, becoming the first Canadian to walk in space in 2001.
                In
                the 1990s, Haley Harrison first heard Armstrong's words on an educational tape about space. “I was
                very
                young, probably 4 or 5 years old,” she recollected, “I just listened to the tape over and over. I
                would
                imagine myself on the shuttle…and I would pretend I was going up to space.” Harrison is now a Ph.D.
                candidate studying nanoscience at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, with goals of
                working
                in the space industry.</p>

                <p>NASA is not only required by law (e.g. the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976) to give the public access
                    to
                    many of its materials, the Agency really wants people to use them.</p>

            <p>Footage and audio of the <a href="#">Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong</a> and lunar module pilot
                Buzz
                Aldrin hopping on the Moon's surface in 1969 have been remixed, remastered, and reshared countless
                times—inspiring generations of everyday citizens, like Hadfield and Harrison, to engage
                <em>with</em>
                space science and exploration. In fact, the use of materials created by the National Aeronautics and
                Space Administration (NASA) to create new works for the public doesn't end with Armstrong's
                history-making first steps.

            <p>For example, Alex G. Orphanos, a science communicator, engineer, and host of the Today in Space
                podcast,
                has put NASA's materials to use for over six years. In particular, he has used images from the
                Hubble
                Space Telescope and information from NASA Procurement to better explain space-related issues to his
                audience. Rachael Eidson, a business development specialist for <strong>Trenton Systems</strong> and
                social media influencer also routinely uses NASA's images in her collaborations with eco-fashion and
                accessory companies. In fact, it's hard to miss the resurgence of space-themed items, including
                t-shirts, mugs, bags, etc. featuring NASA's “meatball” logo. As the L.A. Times reported in 2019,
                “The
                NASA logo is having a moment.”</p>
